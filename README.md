Course Description
 An introduction to relational databases, one of the most pervasive technologies today. Presentation covers
 fundamental concepts necessary for the design, use, and implementation of relational database systems.
 Focus is on basic concepts of database modeling and design, the languages and facilities provided by
 database management systems, and techniques for implementing relational database systems. Topics
 include implementation concepts and techniques for database design, query optimization, concurrency
 control, recovery, and integrity. A foundation for managing databases in important environments is provided.
 Assignments require use of a remote access laboratory.


  Project
 There is 1 project in this course that will provide you with relevant real life hands-on experience.
 Students will be asked to design and implement a database of your choice (Banking Transaction Management System).
 TOTAL WEIGHT: Project is worth 40% of your final grade.
 The project has four steps -  
STEP 1 (4%) - Write a 1-2 page Statement of Work (SOW) to describe the need to create, design and
 implement the database that you propose for your project.
 STEP 2 (4%) - Create requirement definition document and use ER Assistant, Visio, or SQL Developer Data
 Modeler to create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for your project.
 STEP 3 (16%) - Use SQL DDL statements to create your tables/views/triggers and other required database
 objects for you project. Also include queries (select statements on database catalog/data dictionary such as
 user_objects and user_tables) to demonstrate all objects are created successfully.
 STEP 4 (16%) - Use SQL DML statements to insert sample data into your tables. Use SQL SELECT
 statements to query your data. 
You will create a technical report that outlines all the steps and studies conducted in implementing the
 project. A template is available in the hands-on resources.
